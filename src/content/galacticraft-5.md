Welcome to the first Galacticraft dev blog. We know it has been a while since our last announcement so lets start this month with a bang!

# Development History

This project first began in March 2019 as a complete rewrite of Galacticraft 4. We acquired Micdoodleâ€™s permission to create a rewrite of the mod to run on the new mod loader at the time called Fabric, and called the mod "Galacticraft: Rewoven".

In November 2020, Micdoodle decided to make this rewrite the next Galacticraft, and the rewrite became Galacticraft 5. It's been in progress ever since version 1.14 of Minecraft!

# Development Status

Galacticraft 5 is currently in development for Minecraft 1.18. We plan to immediately update to the latest Minecraft versions as they release, which minimizes the amount of work that would be required if we stayed on an earlier version and then tried porting everything to the newest version.

Galacticraft 5 is focused on enhancing and updating existing features with new content and textures, some of them can be seen in this dev blog.

We are planning to release an alpha version of Galacticraft 5, which will run exclusively on the Fabric mod loader. In the beta release of the mod, it will use the [Architectury API](https://github.com/architectury) which allows us to develop for both Fabric and Forge using the same shared codebase.

# Music

Music is a big part of the Galacticraft vibe, working on it leads us to newer soundtracks designed for Venus, Mars, the Asteroids and the Space station.

These are mainly composed with the help of electronic instruments, but also embellished using acoustic instruments so as to modernize the sound. Besides, we wanted to preserve but remaster two soundtracks : spacerace and orbit, resulting in a softer tone and more spatialization.

Plus, a good atmosphere also means adding Sound effects to events, mobs, tools and mechanisms. It will apply to rocket types, space mobs, caves, crashed probes, hydraulic platforms, chest dungeons, tools and more.

# Machine GUIs

The new GUIs are inspired by BuildCraft and Thermal Expansion. We have added redstone control, side configuration, statistics and security.
